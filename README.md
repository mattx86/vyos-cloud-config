Cloud Configs for Building and Installing from the VyOS ISO

## How to use
1. Choose the cloud config `.yml` file that best suits you.
2. Choose `Debian 11` as your OS.
3. Copy and paste the cloud config `.yml` contents where applicable for your cloud.  (I make use of Hetzner Cloud, though your cloud may work without any changes necessary.)
4. The VyOS ISO will be built and booted or built and served over `HTTP` and `HTTPS`.  Enjoy!
